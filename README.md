## Installation instructions
1.  Run `sudo apt install libcurses-ui-perl` to get the necessary cpan modules.
2.	Create a login user, and add your SSH pubkey to their authorized_keys. Make sure you can login.
3.	Copy/clone the contents of bin/ to /usr/local/bin/.
4.	Edit /etc/passwd and set the login shell of the login user to /usr/local/bin/ssh-user-shell.sh
